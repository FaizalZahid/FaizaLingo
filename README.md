### Note:
The [compiled version](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=10yIvApMn0lEF__18-l66SoX9oP4CeXdF) (using Pyinstaller) on my website is still not updated:
1. `House of Hikmah` is still called `Bayt al-Hikmah 2.0` (previous name)
2. I didn't put the credit for the notes from [jpn-language.com](https://jpn-language.com/category/learn-japanese/grammar) (my bad, I searched for it again)
3. etc.

I will compile it again for major changes rather than minor changes.

Do contact me [here](https://house-of-hikmah.canny.io/feedback-issues-or-suggestions) for feedback or simply create an issue on this repo, I guess
